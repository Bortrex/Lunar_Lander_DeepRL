# DeepRL - Gradient-free optimization method

Gradient-Free optimization methods are able to optimize a function without computing its gradient.
In RL, this means that they allow to improve a policy without having to compute the gradient of its parameters.

## Population methods

Population methods are a nice choice for complex optimization problems where traditional methods fail to perform adequately due to issues like non-differentiability, high dimensionality, or rugged search landscapes.
